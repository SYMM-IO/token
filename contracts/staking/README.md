# SymmStaking Contract

## Overview

SymmStaking is an upgradeable, multi-token reward staking contract. It allows users to stake a designated token (SYMM) to earn rewards in multiple whitelisted reward tokens. The contract incorporates security features like access control, reentrancy protection, and pausability. 

Staking is a core component of the Symmio ecosystem, designed to reward long-term participation and support for the platform. By staking the native $SYMM token, token holders can directly contribute to the networkâ€™s security and liquidity, while earning a portion of the settlement fees generated from derivatives trading. Symmio will use this contract to distribute a portion of protocol fees to Symmio holders. As Symmio is deployed on multiple chains, there might be multiple reward tokens.
